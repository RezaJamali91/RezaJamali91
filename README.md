👋 Hello there! I'm an ambitious and innovative technology enthusiast who thrives in dynamic and challenging environments.

Previously, I worked in a dedicated team of 10, developing smart home solutions leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT). Our team used technology in innovative ways to automate homes, thus enhancing living experiences with the cutting-edge trends of our time.

I further broadened my horizons at the esteemed University of Rostock in Germany, earning a Master's degree in Applied Sciences with a specialization in Information Technology and Informatics Engineering. This venture equipped me with a solid foundation in technology, greatly enriching my skills and knowledge.

Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in machine learning methodologies and video processing, focusing on their intersections with the IoT and embedded systems. I explored how these technologies could be employed to push the boundaries of what's possible.

🎯 As an engineering graduate, I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and experience in data analysis, where I can make a significant impact.

🔍 My interests span across several domains. I'm keen on developing with Python and C++, building circuits and PCBs with tools like Altium, Proteus, and Eagle, and programming microcontrollers. I'm also intrigued by embedded hardware and software engineering, and developing computer vision applications with OpenCV.

🌱 I'm passionate about sharing my learnings and experiences, and consistently document these on my personal website: https://www.IRLC.ir

💞️ I’m open to collaborations on projects that involve the aforementioned interests, particularly those that align with my pursuit of innovating solutions that make a difference.

📫 Feel free to reach me on my website: https://www.IRLC.ir. I'm always open to exploring new opportunities and engaging in enlightening discussions.
